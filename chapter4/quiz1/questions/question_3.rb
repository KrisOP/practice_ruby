# Write a program that:
# * Calculates the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.
#   * The first Fibonacci number is 0.
#   * The second Fibonacci number is 1.
#   * Every Fibonacci number after that is calculated by adding the
#     previous two Fibonacci numbers together e.g. the third Fibonacci
#     number is the result of `0 + 1`.
# * `puts`es these numbers, one per line.

 a = 0
 b = 1

for i in 1..20

   puts b

    a,b = b,a+b
